Perfect — I’ve gone through **both the EY Techathon 6.0 guidelines** and **your AutoSenseAI solution deck**. Below is a **single, powerful MASTER PROMPT** you can directly paste into **Replit AI** to **build the complete solution from scratch**, exactly aligned with **EY Technonakon / Techathon 6.0 evaluation & PPT requirements**.

I’ve designed this so that:

* The output is **demo-ready**
* Matches **EY slides 4–8 expectations**
* Produces a **working prototype** you can screen-share
* Is realistic for a **hackathon timeline**

## 🔥 MASTER PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI (COPY–PASTE)

---

### 🧠 Project Context

You are building a **production-grade, demo-ready Agentic AI system** named **AutoSenseAI** for **EY Techathon 6.0**.
The solution is for the **automotive industry (B2B + B2C)** and focuses on **autonomous predictive maintenance, smart service scheduling, and closed-loop feedback to OEM manufacturing teams**.

The solution must strictly follow **EY Techathon 6.0 submission guidelines**, including:

* Clear problem–solution mapping
* Architecture & flow diagrams
* Working prototype (MANDATORY)
* Demonstrable UI + backend logic
* Scalable, secure, and innovative design

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Vehicle maintenance today is **reactive, fragmented, and inefficient**, leading to:

* Unexpected breakdowns
* Poor service center utilization
* Low customer satisfaction
* No structured RCA/CAPA feedback to OEM manufacturing teams

There is a need for an **autonomous, intelligent system** that:

* Predicts failures early using telematics data
* Proactively schedules service
* Communicates with customers via AI agents
* Creates a continuous quality improvement loop for OEMs

---

## 🚀 Solution Vision (What You Must Build)

Build **AutoSenseAI**, an **Agentic AI-based predictive maintenance platform** with:

### Core Capabilities

1. **Predictive Failure Detection**

   * Use simulated vehicle telemetry data
   * ML-based anomaly detection & failure prediction
2. **Agentic AI Orchestration**

   * Master Agent coordinating Worker Agents:

     * Prediction Agent
     * Diagnosis Agent
     * Scheduling Agent
     * Customer Voice/Chat Agent
     * RCA Feedback Agent
3. **Smart Service Scheduling**

   * Auto-book service slots based on urgency & availability
4. **Customer Interaction**

   * Chatbot / Voice-bot (text-based simulation is acceptable)
5. **OEM Dashboard**

   * Analytics, alerts, RCA insights
6. **Closed Feedback Loop**

   * Service outcomes → manufacturing insights

---

## 🧱 Technical Requirements (MANDATORY)

Build the project with the following stack (can simulate where needed):

### Backend

* **Python + FastAPI**
* REST APIs for predictions, scheduling, feedback
* Modular agent-based architecture

### ML / AI

* Scikit-learn (RandomForest / IsolationForest)
* Rule-based fallback logic
* Simulated real-time telemetry input

### Frontend

* **React OR Streamlit**
* Clean dashboard for:

  * OEM view
  * Service center view
  * Vehicle owner view

### Database

* SQLite / PostgreSQL
* Tables for vehicles, alerts, bookings, feedback

### Deployment

* Fully runnable on **Replit**
* Clear `README.md` with run steps

---

## 📊 Functional Modules to Implement

### 1️⃣ Telemetry Simulator

* Generate vehicle sensor data (temperature, vibration, RPM, error codes)

### 2️⃣ Predictive Engine

* Detect anomalies
* Predict failure probability
* Threshold-based alert triggering

### 3️⃣ Agent Orchestration Layer

* Master Agent routes tasks
* Worker Agents act independently
* Logs agent decisions

### 4️⃣ Smart Scheduler

---

## 🔐 Non-Functional Requirements

* Modular & scalable
* Secure API design
* Easily extensible
* Hackathon-demo friendly
* Clear separation of concerns

---

## 📐 Mandatory EY Deliverables (Must Generate)

You must automatically generate:

1. **System Architecture Diagram (textual + Mermaid if possible)**
2. **End-to-End Flow Chart**
3. **Wireframe Screens (basic UI layouts)**
4. **Demo Dataset**
5. **Screenshots / UI views**
6. **Working prototype**

---

## 📁 Output Expectations

* Complete runnable code
* Clear folder structure
* README with demo instructions
* Sample API calls
* Mock data included
* Comments explaining agent decisions

---

## 🏁 Final Instruction

Build this project **as if it will be evaluated by EY judges** on:

* Innovation
* Technology depth
* Business impact
* Demonstrability

Start by:

1. Creating project structure
2. Building backend APIs
3. Adding ML logic
4. Implementing frontend
5. Connecting everything end-to-end

---

### 🚨 IMPORTANT

Do **not** skip the working prototype.
Everything must be **demo-ready** and **screen-shareable**.
